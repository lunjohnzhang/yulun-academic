My name is Yulun Zhang (张宇伦). I am a second year Ph.D. student in [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Professor [Jiaoyang Li](https://jiaoyangli.me/). Currently I am focusing on **environment optimization for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms** using [***Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization***](https://quality-diversity.github.io/) and generative AI methods. As a long-term goal, I would like to bring QD optimization and Evolutionary Optimization to Robotics, expanding their applicability and scalability.

Previously, I was a master/undergrad student majoring in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I was working in [ICAROS](http://icaros.usc.edu/) lab at USC with Professor [Stefanos Nikolaidis](https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/) and [Matt Fontaine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-fontaine-53510b122/) on [**surrogate assisted QD optimization**](/publication/zhang2022dsa-me) and [**scenario generation for human-robot coordination**](https://overcooked-lsi.github.io/). I was also working in [RESL](https://robotics.usc.edu/resl/) at USC with [Dr. Ryan Julian](https://ryanjulian.me/) and [K.R. Zentner](https://zentner.io/) on [**transfer learning for robotics**](https://sites.google.com/view/task-policy-transfer).

In addition, I was working in the [USC Interaction Lab](https://uscinteractionlab.web.app/) with [Dr. Matt Rueben](https://matthewrueben.github.io/) on [**socially assistive robotics**](publication/rueben2021volume/) as well as Professor {{< staticref "https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~halfond/" "newtab" >}}William Halfond{{< /staticref >}}'s group on [**record and replay tools for Android**](project/reran/).

Here is my most recent [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ot0eYf0LyIGTvd8XhZevaTdCLRkjf4fk/view?usp=sharing) (updated May 2023).

I am also enthusiastic about photography, especially scenery photography. Check out [my photography portfolio](https://yulunzhang.myportfolio.com/) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lunjohnzhang/) for some of my works.
