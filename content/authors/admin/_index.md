My name is Yulun Zhang (张宇伦). I am a second year Ph.D. student in Robotics Institute at the Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Professor [Jiaoyang Li](https://jiaoyangli.me/). My research interests include human-robot collaboration, multi-robot coordination, evolutionary algorithms, and quality diversity optimization. Currently I am focusing on environment optimization for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms. As a long-term goal, I would like to bring Quality Diversity Optimization and Evolutionary Optimization to Robotics, expanding their applicability and scalability.

Previously, I was a master/undergrad student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I was working in Interactive and Collaborative Autonomous Robotics ({{< staticref "http://icaros.usc.edu/" "newtab" >}}ICAROS{{< /staticref >}}) lab at USC with Professor {{< staticref "https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/" "newtab" >}}Stefanos Nikolaidis{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-fontaine-53510b122/" "newtab" >}}Matt Fontaine{{< /staticref >}}. I was also working in Robotic Embedded Systems Laboratory ({{< staticref "https://robotics.usc.edu/resl/" "newtab" >}}RESL{{< /staticref >}}) at USC with {{< staticref "https://ryanjulian.me/" "newtab" >}}Dr. Ryan Julian{{< /staticref >}} and [K.R. Zentner](https://zentner.io/).

In addition, I was working in the {{< staticref "https://uscinteractionlab.web.app/" "newtab" >}}USC Interaction Lab{{< /staticref >}} with {{< staticref "https://matthewrueben.github.io/" "newtab" >}}Dr. Matt Rueben{{< /staticref >}} on Socially Assistive Robotics as well as Professor {{< staticref "https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~halfond/" "newtab" >}}William Halfond{{< /staticref >}}'s group on record and replay tools for Android.

Here is my most recent [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ot0eYf0LyIGTvd8XhZevaTdCLRkjf4fk/view?usp=sharing) (updated May 2023).

I am also enthusiastic about photography, especially scenery photography. Check out [my portfolio](https://yulunzhang.myportfolio.com/) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lunjohnzhang/) for some of my works.
